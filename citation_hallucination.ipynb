    "Suppose Alex Martinez is unhappy with the proposed 20% rent increase and additional restrictions on subletting, and he believes these terms to be unjust given current market conditions. Based on the 'Tenancy Matters' document, what specific legal actions can Alex take to contest the new terms? Please detail the process for filing a grievance with the relevant tenancy board, including any documentation he might need to prepare, the possible legal arguments he could use to support his case, and the typical timeline for such proceedings. Additionally, explore any alternative dispute resolution options available to him, such as mediation or arbitration, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages compared to formal legal action"

    "\n",
    "According to the 'Tenancy Matters' document, Alex Martinez can contest the new terms of the tenancy agreement by filing a grievance with the relevant tenancy board, which is the Rating and Valuation Department (“RVD”). He would need to submit Form AR2 or Form CR109 to RVD by the statutory time limit concerned (see Q16 and Q2 above) [Tenancy_matters-5]. He may argue that the proposed rent increase and additional restrictions on subletting are unjust given current market conditions. To support his case he can provide evidence of comparable rents for similar properties in the same area [Tenancy_matters-1]. The typical timeline for such proceedings are not provided in the sources. Alternative dispute resolution options available to him include mediation or arbitration. Mediation is a voluntary process that can take place before or after filing a legal claim and is typically faster and less expensive than going to court. Arbitration is a process where an arbitrator listens to both sides and makes a decision that is legally binding, but it can be more expensive and time-consuming than mediation ***[no relevant source found]***.\n"
